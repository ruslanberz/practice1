Here is the benefits of using GitHub:
First of all the use of github gives us a version control. We can easily
control all of code/software version changes and flip back anytime something goes wrong.
Very usefull code indications show us which lines of code were changed, as well as old and new ones
(old code lines are marked red, while chenged ones are marked green)
The second major feature is Hardware independency, where we can easily get access to our code from any device,
now we do not have to carry our code on flash or orther types of storage devices.
Third major feature is geographical independency- we can easily work with team from all over the world on the same project.
Another advantage using github is access control. All repositories are either private or public, to use private ones we have to pay 7$ monthly
fee. For private repositories we can keep them private (only 1 person can have access to code) or give special access to project mates
(but for all others the view of project is restricted)
